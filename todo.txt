# At initialization read actual position from driver chip. Actual code set to 0 actual position variable.

# Implement error handler because there are too many places where the error is to be generated.

#10:39 PM 1/16/2016 Check function void L6474_StepClockHandler(uint8_t deviceId). After reset alway execute a hard stop even the command is
to execute a soft stop. This condition (relativePos >= devicePrm[deviceId].stepsToTake) is true first time after Reset.
Test is done using User Button (blue button). First press motor is running then second press motor is soft stop. Fail firs time after reset
to take a soft stop.
